This document specifies the network protocol used to communicate between the Mido's House Multiworld server (`ootrmwd`) and app (`multiworld-gui`).

The protocol is versioned with respect to breaking changes from a client's perspective, e.g. new client→server messages may be added without a protocol version change but not new server→client messages. The protocol version corresponds to the major [release](https://github.com/midoshouse/ootr-multiworld/releases) version of the first-party client. The current version is 17. Each previous version remains available and supported until 6 months have passed since the last time a client with this version has connected or disconnected, or until 2 years have passed since the following version was released, whichever happens first.

This API is available at `wss://mw.midos.house/v17`. All messages are binary [WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) messages. The message kind is determined from the direction of the message and the first byte according to the following two sections. The data types that appear in the messages are defined in the third section below. All data types are [big-endian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness). A message that contains multiple fields of data or a compound data type is simply represented as each field in sequence, so you may have to read one field to know where the next field starts. Names of messages, of message fields, and of compound data types are listed here for reference only, they do not appear in the binary forms of the messages themselves.

# Changes from version 16

* All settings other than `keyring_give_bk` have been removed from Client→Server message `0x0d` SendAll.
* The `randomized_settings` field has been removed from Client→Server message `0x0d` SendAll.
* Client→Server messages `0x04` Stop and `0x11` WaitUntilEmpty have been removed, their message IDs must no longer be sent and may be reused for new messages in future protocol versions.
* The [file hash](#file-hash) fields in Server→Client messages `0x11` PlayerFileHash and `0x14` WrongFileHash as well as Client→Server message `0x0f` FileHash are now [optional](#optional). No file hash represents a seed rolled on a randomizer version from before co-op context version 4.

# Server→Client

## `0x00` Ping

This message contains no data (other than the message kind, i.e. its length is always exactly 1 byte). The client must reply with a Ping message of its own. This message is sent by the server every 30 seconds; clients may wish to consider it a network error if no message is received for 60 seconds.

## `0x01` StructuredError

This message has a single one-byte field which defines the type of error that occurred. These errors should not be considered fatal: the client may handle the error, e.g. by displaying it to the user, and then continue the network session normally.

* `0x00` WrongPassword: The client attempted to join a room but sent the wrong password.
* `0x01` RoomExists: The client attempted to create a room with a name that's already taken by another room.
* `0x02` NoMidosHouseAccountDiscord: The client attempted to sign into Mido's House using Discord but there is no Mido's House account associated with the given Discord account.
* `0x03` NoMidosHouseAccountRaceTime: The client attempted to sign into Mido's House using racetime.gg but there is no Mido's House account associated with the given racetime.gg account.
* `0x04` SessionExpiredDiscord: The client attempted to sign in with an expired Discord session token.
* `0x05` SessionExpiredRaceTime: The client attempted to sign in with an expired racetime.gg session token.
* `0x06` ConflictingItemKinds: Clients have reported multiple different items from the same location in the same world. This is [a known issue](https://github.com/midoshouse/ootr-multiworld/issues/43) which is currently being investigated and needs more data — the client should offer to send recent logs, if any, to the developer of the client.

Additional error types may be added without a major version bump, so clients should treat any unknown error type as a generic fatal error.

## `0x02` OtherError

This message has a single [string](#string) field containing an error message. The client should display the message to the user and terminate the connection — usually the server will also terminate the connection.

## `0x03` EnterLobby

Moves the client into the lobby. The server may send this message under several circumstances, including but not limited to after receiving a new connection, if the client leaves a room, if the client is kicked from a room, or if the room the client is in is deleted. This message has a single field (the room list) which is a [map](#map) where each key is an 8-byte number (the room ID) and each value consists of a [string](#string) (the room name) followed by a [Boolean](#boolean) indicating whether this room requires a password.

## `0x04` NewRoom

Sent to a client in the lobby to indicate that a new room has been added to the list, or that an existing room's data has changed. This may be sent because the room was newly created or renamed, but also because the client has signed in, making a private room visible or removing the password requirement from an existing room. Consists of the following fields:

* `id`: The room ID, an 8-byte number. Uniquely identifies this room, indicating whether this is a newly visible room or a change to an existing room's data.
* `name`: The room name, a [string](#string).
* `password_required`: Whether a password is required to join this room, a [Boolean](#string).

## `0x05` DeleteRoom

Sent to a client in the lobby to indicate that a room has been deleted, or is no longer visible to the client. This message has a single field, an 8-byte number indicating the ID of the removed room.

## `0x06` EnterRoom

Moves the client into a room. Consists of the following fields:

* `room_id`: The room ID, an 8-byte number.
* `players`: A [list](#list) of [players](#player) describing the clients in this room which are associated with a world.
* `num_unassigned_clients`: A 1-byte number of clients in this room which are not associated with any world, including the client this message is sent to.
* `autodelete_delta`: A [duration](#duration) specifying how long the server waits to automatically delete this room after the last item is sent to it.

## `0x0d` ItemQueue

Sent to a client in a room to define the full list of items that have been sent to it, including ones that have already been received. This may be sent multiple times, in which case the previous state of the incoming item queue should be replaced with this data. Consists of a [list](#list) of 2-byte numbers corresponding to the get item IDs defined by the randomizer. Note that get item ID `0x00ca` (Triforce Piece) should be treated specially.

## `0x0e` GetItem

Sent to a client in a room to add an item to the end of its incoming item queue. Consists of a 2-byte number corresponding to a get item ID defined by the randomizer. Note that get item ID `0x00ca` (Triforce Piece) should be treated specially.

## `0x0f` AdminLoginSuccess

## `0x11` PlayerFileHash

Sent to a client in a room to inform it about the file hash loaded by a client. This may be used to provide additional information to the user in the event that a WrongFileHash message is received. This message is sent to all clients in the room, including the client that reported its file hash. Consists of the client's world number as a 1-byte number which will never be zero, followed by the client's new [optional](#optional) [file hash](#file-hash), where no file hash represents a seed rolled on a randomizer version from before co-op context version 4.

## `0x12` AutoDeleteDelta

Sent to a client in a room when the duration of inactivity after which this room will be automatically deleted is changed. Consists of the new [duration](#duration).

## `0x13` RoomsEmpty

Sent to a client in the lobby which has sent the WaitUntilEmpty message (available only on protocol versions 16 and below) once there are no players with claimed worlds in any of the rooms. This message is deprecated and will be removed once support for protocol version 16 ends. It contains no data.

## `0x14` WrongFileHash

Sent to a client in a room if it reports a file hash that doesn't match the file hash set for this room, either as previously reported by a client, or as set by the Mido's House integration for a tournament room. Consists of the [optional](#optional) [file hash](#file-hash) required for this room, followed by the [optional](#optional) [file hash](#file-hash) reported by the client. In both cases, no file hash represents a seed rolled on a randomizer version from before co-op context version 4. No file hash is considered to be compatible with no file hash, but no file hash and any given file hash are considered incompatible.

## `0x15` ProgressiveItems

Sent to a client in a room to update the progressive item state for a client. This message is sent to all clients in the room, including the client whose progressive item state is being updated, though the game currently ignores the player's own progressive item state. Consists of the client's world number as a 1-byte number which will never be zero, followed by the progressive item state, which is 4 bytes of data that should be transparently forwarded to the game. See the documentation for `MW_PROGRESSIVE_ITEMS_ENABLE` and `MW_PROGRESSIVE_ITEMS_STATE` in [the co-op context docs](https://github.com/OoTRandomizer/OoT-Randomizer/blob/Dev/Notes/coop-ctx.md) for details.

## `0x16` LoginSuccess

Confirms to the client that its LoginApiKey, LoginDiscord, or LoginRaceTime message was successful. This message contains no data.

## `0x17` WorldTaken

Sent to a client in a room if it attempts to claim a world number that is currently assigned to a different client in the room. The client should give the user the option to either kick the other client or to leave the room, while also checking for a different rom being loaded to notify the server of a changed world number. Consists of the world number in question as a 1-byte number which will never be zero.

## `0x18` WorldFreed

Sent after a WorldTaken message to indicate that the world is no longer taken. This message contains no data.

## `0x19` MaintenanceNotice

* `id`: The room ID, an 8-byte number.
* `password`: The room password, an [optional](#optional) [string](#string). The presence of this field should correspond to whether this room requires a password, as reported by the server in the EnterLobby or NewRoom message that most recently updated this room's data. An empty password is considered distinct from no password.

## `0x02` CreateRoom

Attempt to create a new room. If this is successful, the server will move the client into the newly created room using an EnterRoom message. Consists of the following fields:

* `world_count`: The number of worlds in the seed, a 1-byte number which must not be zero.

## `0x0c` SaveData

Updates the client's state using the contents of the save file. Should be sent each time the player opens a save file. The server uses this information to update the progressive item state, as well as for auto-tracking. Consists of the contents of the save data, a blob `0x1450` bytes in length. See <https://wiki.cloudmodding.com/oot/Save_Format> for details.

## `0x0d` SendAll

Requests that all remaining items from the given world be distributed. Useful when a player stops playing the seed but the other players want to continue playing. Consists of the following fields, all of which except for `source_world` should be sourced from the seed's spoiler log:
